    "@value" : "This gallery reunites five Images / Artworks created by the Cuban artist Ana\nMendieta (1948-1985) between 1972 and 1984, reflecting her work using different\nmedia tools (photography, performance, sculpture, drawing illustration, natural\nelements) and exploring the topics related to exile, connection between humans and\nearth, women condition in a patriarchal context and the violence it is subjected to,\nand it's Latin American roots connected with the spiritual Cuban rituals. These\nchosen images are connected in different ways to tell her artist and life history, as a chronological and autobiographical process; all of\nthem are contained in the MoMA's Collection. The \"Photography Series\" has been a\nway to present her different ideas, questioning traditional beauty concepts and\nrepresenting spiritual and earth images through silhouettes and her body. At the end\nof her life (1985), ni 1984 presented a book with Carle Andre, an artist, her husband, and his suspected killer, a book of nature illustrations. In addition, in his sculpture\n\"Nile Born\" (1984), an inner channel that suggests a vaginal cavity created with sand,\nsynthesizes herwholeinterest in \"returning to the material source\" as she stated, and generates a synthesis of his artistic proposal before his death. Her vast\ninfluence on Feminism Art, Land Art, Body Art, and Performance is known around the world. Moreover, despite her short life, she was one of the most influential Latin American contemporary artists of the 20th century, and that is why it is important to honor his life.",

These photos belong to this group of images and tried to challenge the conventional notions of women's beauty by transforming herself in several ways through self-portraits. For these photographs, Mendieta presses her face and parts of her body onto a square sheet of plexiglass, distorting and transforming the appearance of her physical features and youthful beauty. By using her own body as a malleable, sculptural material, Mendieta eliminates traditional visual components of image making, relying instead on the power of her own body as a tool to reexamine the archetype human subject and the gaze in photography. The series marks the artist's first works of the time- based performance for which she would become known."

The sculptures made tangible Mendieta's belief of the earth as a goddess, rooted in Afro-Cuban Santería and the indigenous Taíno practices of her homeland. Mendieta's \"Silueta Series\"\n(1973-1980), explores the connections between nature and the female body. This photograph documents an ephemeral sculpture - in the shape of the artist's silhouette and loosely evocative of ancient goddess archetypes - carved directly into the earth with minimal disruption of the environment. Returning to a metaphorical womb and her native Cuban homeland as she molded a feminist subject and land art processes to explore the theme of Exile. She used the natural environment as a perpetual setting throughout her career, most memorably in her earth-works such as Siluetas, which were created in various natural locations with meaning to the artist and adorned with elements indigenous to the areas. The powerful work washed away all evidence of the artist's presence. In doing so, it evoked the cycles of life, of birth and death, and of coming from and returning to the womb/earth- or simply, that unexplained spiritual place of vast mystery paid homage to in ritual such as this performance."

This work was a result of the \"Siluetas Series\" and is meant to show the organic materials' fragility and it's attached to the physical place were created. \n\"Nile Born\" is one of the last Siluetas Mendieta made before she died in 1985, and the title refers to Cuba's African heritage.\n\"The work is an arresting exploration of self, place, belonging, and alienation, concepts that\npermeate Mendieta's entire oeuvre of installations, earthworks, performances, videos, and sculptures\" (MoMA, Publication excerpt from The Museum of Modern Art, MoMA\nHighlights since 1980, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, p. 48).
